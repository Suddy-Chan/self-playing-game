# AI Village Simulation

A game where AI characters learn to play themselves based on reinforcement learning. Watch as Bob, Alice, and Charlie learn to survive by gathering resources, building houses, and farming food.

## Game Overview

In this simulation, three AI characters with different personalities interact with their environment to survive. Each character:
- Has a health (HP) system that slowly decays over time
- Moves faster when healthy and slower when injured
- Can gather resources, build houses, and farm food
- Learns from their actions through a Q-learning system
- Has unique personality traits affecting their behavior

## Controls

As a player, you can help the AI characters by adding resources to the environment:
1. Move your mouse to the desired location in the game area
2. Press keys:
   - `1`: Plant a tree ðŸŒ±
   - `2`: Plant food ðŸŒ¾

## Characters

The simulation features three characters with distinct colors:
- Bob (Red)
- Alice (Green)
- Charlie (Blue)

Each character has:
- Health Points (HP)
- Food inventory
- Unique personality traits affecting:
  - Gathering efficiency
  - Building preference
  - Farming preference

## Actions

Characters can perform various actions:
- Chop trees for wood
- Harvest food
- Build houses (requires 5 wood)
- Farm food (requires 1 food, produces 2 food)

## UI Elements

The game interface shows:
- Player controls and instructions
- World resources (Trees, Food, Next resource spawn timer)
- Character stats (Name, HP, Food inventory)
- Visual feedback for actions and resource spawns

## Resource System

- Resources regenerate automatically over time
- Maximum limits: 20 trees, 10 food sources
- Resources only spawn in the game area (below UI panels)
- Visual animations show when new resources appear

## Learning System

Characters use Q-learning to:
- Learn from their actions and rewards
- Adapt their behavior based on needs
- Balance exploration and exploitation
- Consider their personality traits when making decisions
